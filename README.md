Data Engineering Toolkit
The Data Engineering Toolkit is a collection of Python scripts designed to support common data engineering tasks. These tools help with moving, transforming, storing, and serving data. The overall aim is to turn raw, unstructured, and often messy datasets into reliable, well-structured, and accessible resources for data scientists, analysts, and business intelligence platforms.

Purpose
This repository serves as a lightweight toolkit for building data pipelines. It includes scripts that demonstrate data cleaning, transformation, and loading processes, mirroring the steps in typical pipeline development.

 Script Overview
•	data_cleaning.py – Handles missing values and removes duplicate records.
•	data_transformation.py – Provides functions for normalization and custom transformation logic.
•	data_loading.py – Saves cleaned and transformed data to different file formats or databases.

Would you like me to also merge this with the earlier README draft I gave you so you have one single, polished README.md instead of two separate versions?
